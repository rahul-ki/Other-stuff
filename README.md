Everything else that I want to put up but doesn't fit in other repositories 

## Discordbot.py
Someone asked me to go to Marks&Spencers FAQ page. Choose any 3 questions and create a chatbot on it.So here it is - what I could program in the 15 minutes that I had (and ya it was my first chat bot, thus 15 minutes). I guess for any internship interview on bots I can show them this now :P. To run it, first compile it in either the IDLE Compiler or command line (Python version 3.6) and then go to the discord bot website (https://discord.gg/jf7T5Ma) to see it answer the `3 defined questions` - 
Can I get free home delivery?
How do I find out the opening times, addresses and facilities for M&S stores in the UK?
I have lost my receipt, can I still get a refund?
Also added an extra functionality where you can type in anything starting with `"hi", "hello" or "hey"` and it tags you and replies "hey, what can I do for you?"
Everything is `case-INSENSITIVE`.

## International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) - 3 files
The time when I did some extra basic Aeronautics. The files assignment.py and sec2 part e.py were done to help my friend, who was at doing an Astronautics degre.I did ISA.py for myself because I was doing a basic introduction to Astronautics and that involved the atmosphere.

The 3 files are basically quiet similar to themselves. They take in a height and ouput out temperature, pressure and density at that height. Different stages of the atmosphere have different properties and thus need special equations to determine their values.`g = 9.80065` but because g is downwards we use g as negative so `g = -9.80065`. Using the SI Units, `Pressure` is measured in `Pascal(Pa)`, `Temperature` in `Kelvin(K)`, `Density` in `kg/m3` (metre-cubed)
